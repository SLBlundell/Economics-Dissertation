# Herding within Chinese Equity Markets in Response to COVID-19 'Lockdown Style' Containment Measures

This repository contains the files and data associated with my Applied Economics Dissertation, which I am producing as part of my BSc Economics degree at the University of Bristol.

My research focuses on 'herding' within financial markets - the theory that investors will forego their private information in favour of following the public decisions of other investors. Academics and observers alike have expressed concerns such behaviour could lead to excess volatility and asset bubbles that threaten to destabalise fincancial markets. 

Specifically, this dissertation seeks determine whether the additional cognitive stress investors were subject to stemming from 'Lockdown Style' policies within China induced additional herding within equity markets.
